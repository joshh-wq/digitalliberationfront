        <p>We remember buying books at stores, not from Bezos.</p>
        <p>We remember social connection without Zuckerberg's algorithms.</p>
        <p>We remember when "tech" meant possibility, not extraction.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="manifesto-body">We watched these platforms take over. We saw local economies collapse. We saw democracy weaponized. We saw billionaires capture the digital infrastructure of our lives.</p>

      <p class="manifesto-turn">And we know it doesn't have to be this way. Because we remember when it wasn't.</p>

      <div class="manifesto-declaration">
        <p>We're not going back to the hierarchical capitalism that came before.</p>
        <p>We're not accepting the monopolistic extraction of now.</p>
        <p class="declaration-bold">We're building democratic ownership of modern technology. Worker-owned platforms. User-governed networks. Cooperative marketplaces.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="manifesto-body">We're not starting from scratch. Platform cooperatives already exist. Worker-owned businesses have been organizing for decades. Labor unions have fought for economic democracy for generations. We're joining that movement&mdash;amplifying existing work, organizing new builders, creating the infrastructure we need.</p>

      <p class="manifesto-body">We partner with labor unions, cooperative networks, and people-powered movements. This future requires all of us: tech workers who build the platforms, service workers who run them, users who depend on them, organizers who mobilize communities.</p>

      <p class="manifesto-body">Gen Z, Gen X, Boomers&mdash;we need you. This is a multi-generational project. We're building the future together.</p>

      <p class="manifesto-closer">They won't be the future. We will be.</p>

          <li><strong>Proven models:</strong> Co-op grocery stores, credit unions, and mutual aid networks already work. We're applying the model to digital platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Community exists:</strong> Millions of people are already looking for alternatives. The demand is there.</li>
          <li><strong>Builds momentum:</strong> Success in these two domains proves the model and funds expansion into media and organizing tools.</li>

      <h2>Social & Communication</h2>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Every major social platform is owned by a billionaire who has bent the knee to authoritarianism. Meta gutted fact-checking. X became a right-wing megaphone. TikTok's fate is decided by politicians, not users. Our social lives are controlled by people who don't share our values—and we have zero say in how these platforms work.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>What We're Building</h3>
        <p>User-owned social platforms structured as cooperative corporations. Every user is a member-owner. Major decisions—moderation policy, algorithm design, data practices—are voted on democratically. The platform can never be sold to a billionaire because the members own it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>What Already Exists</h3>
        <div class="proof-cards">
          <div class="proof-card"><h4>Bluesky</h4><p>Decentralized, open protocol. Already millions of users. Not a co-op (yet), but its open protocol means no single entity controls it.</p></div>
          <div class="proof-card"><h4>Mastodon</h4><p>Federated social network. Community-run instances. Proves decentralized social media works at scale.</p></div>
          <div class="proof-card"><h4>Signal</h4><p>Nonprofit encrypted messaging. 40M+ users. Proves you don't need ads or data harvesting to build great communication tools.</p></div>
          <div class="proof-card"><h4>Pixelfed</h4><p>Decentralized Instagram alternative. No algorithm, no ads, no Meta. Photo sharing the way it should be.</p></div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>What Still Needs Building</h3>
        <ul class="needs-list">
          <li>A co-op social platform that's as polished and intuitive as Instagram—optimized for real connection, not engagement metrics</li>
          <li>Cooperative governance structures that scale to millions of users</li>
          <li>Sustainable revenue models that don't depend on advertising or selling user data</li>
          <li>Migration tools that make switching from billionaire platforms painless</li>

      <h2>Commerce & Local Economy</h2>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Amazon has hollowed out local economies. Independent bookstores, hardware shops, and artisans can't compete with a company that runs at a loss to crush competitors. Jeff Bezos spiked the Washington Post's endorsement of Harris, pays workers poverty wages, and spends millions busting unions. Every Prime subscription funds this.</p>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>What We're Building</h3>
        <p>City-based marketplace co-ops owned by local merchants. Imagine Amazon's convenience—search, browse, buy online, get delivery—but the merchants own the platform. Revenue stays in your city. No billionaire middleman taking a 40% cut.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>What Already Exists</h3>
        <div class="proof-cards">
          <div class="proof-card"><h4>Bookshop.org</h4><p>Online bookstore that supports independent bookshops. Has distributed over $30M to indie stores. Proves the model works for books.</p></div>
          <div class="proof-card"><h4>Stocksy</h4><p>Artist-owned stock photography co-op. Members earn 50-75% of sales (vs. industry standard of 15-45%). Co-op model, profitable.</p></div>
          <div class="proof-card"><h4>REI</h4><p>Consumer co-op with 23M+ members. $3.7B in revenue. Proves co-ops can compete at massive scale in retail.</p></div>
          <div class="proof-card"><h4>Local food co-ops</h4><p>Thousands of food co-ops across the US. Community-owned, locally sourced, worker-friendly. The OG model we're building on.</p></div>
